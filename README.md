# Cyber-Threat-Detection
The Cyber Attacks Analysis project uses Python to analyze and visualize cybersecurity data. It identifies suspicious IPs, attack types, and threats while displaying patterns and device vulnerabilities through interactive charts and network graphs.

This project focuses on detecting, analyzing, and visualizing cyber attacks using Python. It processes cybersecurity datasets to identify suspicious network activities, attack types, and potential threats. The project also generates interactive visualizations to better understand patterns in cyber incidents.

## Introduction

The Cyber Attacks Analysis project provides an exploratory and visual understanding of cybersecurity data.
It helps identify:

Common attack types

* uspicious IPs

* Device vulnerabilities

* Patterns of malicious activities

This project demonstrates how data analytics and visualization can assist in cyber threat detection and prevention using Python libraries like pandas, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, and networkx.

## Features

🔍 Suspicious IP Detection — Filters data based on predefined suspicious IPs.

📊 Attack Type Analysis — Displays the frequency and distribution of attack types.

💻 Device & OS Detection — Extracts and analyzes device/browser information.

📈 Interactive Visualizations — Uses Plotly for dynamic charts.

🌐 Network Graphs — Visualizes connections between users, devices, and threats.

⚠️ Alerts System — Prints alerts for detected suspicious activities.



Navigate to the project directory:

cd CyberAttacksAnalysis


Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Python script:

python Cyber_Attacks.py

## Usage

Prepare or download your cybersecurity dataset (e.g., cybersecurity_attacks.csv).

Run the script to analyze data and generate plots.

Review:

Attack distributions

Suspicious IP logs

Network visualizations

Customize suspicious IPs or add your own dataset for deeper analysis.

## 📊 Visualization Examples

Pie Charts: Attack types, browsers, and platforms

Histograms: Packet length by attack type

Network Graphs: Relationships between users, devices, and threats

Bar Charts: Count of cyber attacks by type
